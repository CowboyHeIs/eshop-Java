## 3. Clean Code How To
- Naming conventions

## Update 1. 11/03/2025 :
- Laptop finally back after no one knows how long.
- RAM changed and Motherboard fixed, Laptop Reset.
- Reason why took that long :
- - RAM corrupted Windows Update
- - DELL needs long test for this unique error
- - Not all error fixed, just some lightweight remaining (ie. some default apps missing and some DELL update can't)
- Noticed not all codes was updated to github after "git clone"
